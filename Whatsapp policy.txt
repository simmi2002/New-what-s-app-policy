recently updated our Privacy Policy and we
 have received many thoughtful questions.
 With some of the rumors going around, we
 want to answer some of the common questions
 we have received. We go to great lengths to
 build WhatsApp in a way that helps people communicate privately.

We want to be clear that the policy update 
does not affect the privacy of your messages
 with friends or family in any way.
 They changes are related to optional 
business features on WhatsApp, and provides
 further transparency about how we collect 
and use data. Learn more about new business
 features and WhatsApp's Privacy Policy 
update here.
